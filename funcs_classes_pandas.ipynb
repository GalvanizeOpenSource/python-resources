    "\n",
    "Functions are an essential part of coding, and are a way of defining a procedure that you can reuse. They are incredibly helpful in writing clean, readable, and reusable code. I would encourage you to code using functions (or classes) whenever you can. \n",
    "\n",
    "Python has a very large number of built-in functions, as well as a vast repository of modules/libraries through which other functions (as well as classes) are available. Check out the [built-in function docs](https://docs.python.org/2/library/functions.html) to see all of the built-in functions that are available to use. One of the other libraries whose functions I use regularly is the [itertools](https://docs.python.org/2/library/itertools.html) library. \n",
    "\n",
    "From a top-down level, functions name a piece of code that takes an argument/arguments and allows you to write \"tiny commands\". The purpose/use of a functions should typically be able to be described in one sentence, and on average functions should probably be no longer than 10 lines. \n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Functions are defined using a `def` statement, followed by the name that you wish to give the function (this name must follow variable naming conventions), followed by a set of parentheses that contain any potential arguments that may be passed to the function. After that set of parentheses, we place a colon, and then finally we get to write our function code. This function code will fall on one or more indented lines (note that the indentation is **crucial**). \n",

If the variable is **already defined** in the current scope, then it will just take on the new value that you assign it. However, if it is **not defined** in the **current** scope, then Python treats the assignment as a variable definition. Let's take a look at how this plays out..."

    "From [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming): \"Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of \"objects\", which are data structures that contain data, in the form of fields, often known as attributes; and code, in the form of procedures, often known as methods.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Object-oriented programming has many benefits (see *encapsulation*, *polymorphism*, and *inheritance* in the wiki), but it also kind of matches how we think about the world. The world is composed of *objects*, where objects can be people, houses, cars, buildings, etc. These *objects* have some properties about them (i.e. they contain data), and they can do things (i.e. they have methods that can be applied). Object oriented programming approaches a programming problem by using objects that interact with each other, much like they do in the real world. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Some Terminology \n",
    "\n",
    "1.) **Class** - used to refer to the abstract concept of an object.  \n",
    "2.) **Object** - An actual instance of a class.   \n",
    "3.) **Instance** - What Python returns when you tell it to create a class.   \n",
    "4.) **self** - Inside of a class, a variable for the instance/object being accessed (i.e. it holds a reference to the instance/object of that class).  \n",
    "5.) **attribute** / **field** / **property** - A property or piece of data that a class has, stored in a variable. All attributes/fields/properties within a class are assigned via self.  \n",
    "6.) **method** / **procedure** - A block of code that is accessible via the class, and typically acts on or with the classes attributes/fields/properties. All methods/procedures within a class are created via def. (they are really just functions). \n",
    "\n",
    "From here on out, I will treat attribute, field, and property as interchangeable, and I'll do the same with method and procedure. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Defining a Class \n",
    "\n",
    "Much like defining a function, there is a common format to defining a class. It is almost exactly the same as defining a function, but we replace `def` with `class`. That is, we write `class`, then the name of the class that we are defining, followed by a set of parentheses, and finally a colon. After the colon is an indented block of code that we use to define the class attributes and methods. One subtle difference is that with functions, the standard is to name these beginning in lowercase and seperating words with underscores, while with classes, the standard is to name these beginning in uppercase, and not separate words at all. \n",
    "\n",
    "```python \n",
    "class MyClass(): \n",
    "    # Attributes and methods go in here. \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Instantiation\n",
    "\n",
    "Instantiation is just a fancy word for saying that we're going to create an instance of a particular class. \n",
    "\n",
    "```python \n",
    "my_class = MyClass() # Now we have my_class as an instance of MyClass\n",

I have personally never used these in my day to day, but the \\__len\\__(), \\__str\\__(), \\__repr__\\() ones are pretty common. The first lets you use the len() function on instances of your class, and the second to allow you to define a readable display of an instance of your class (used when printing or applying the str() function). \n",

Basically, there is a way to load in data in any format that you might want to load it in from (CSV, JSON, SQL, Excel, HTML). All of these take some form of a `read_` method. So, if we wanted to load data in from a CSV, we would simply use: \n",

    "If we are instantiating a DataFrame from data that already exists in our program, there are a couple of ways we can do this. One is by using the DataFrame constructor and passing in a list of dictionaries. Pandas will create columns with the names as the keys in the dictionary, and the values as the values in the dictionary. It will fill in values for any column that has a value present, and N/A's elsewhere. Another way of doing this is to pass in a list of lists of values as the `data` argument and another list as the `columns` argument."

When writing them yourself, there is a tradeoff between readability and speed that you have to keep in mind. If you are writing code that becomes unwieldy and unreadable but doesn't have huge gains in efficiency (or maybe even if it does), consider writing it in a clearer manner (without a list comp.) even though it may be a little slower. This goes for all your code writing in general."
